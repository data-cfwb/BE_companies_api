# BE companies API

API of belgian companies based on public OpenData from the [Belgian government](https://kbopub.economie.fgov.be/kbo-open-data/login).

# Why this API?

This API is a simple way to get data from the [Belgian government](https://kbopub.economie.fgov.be/kbo-open-data/login). The Banque Carrefour is currently charging a fee for using the API -- currently 50â‚¬ for 2000 requests (20220829).

At OpenJustice.be, we don't like to pay for OpenData and we want to make it free for everyone.
